      <span>Key Takeaway</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      Most buyers underestimate buying costs by <strong>5–10%</strong>. The biggest expense is usually <strong>stamp duty</strong>,
      but advocate fees, valuation, searches, county clearances, and registration charges add up quickly. The safest approach is
      to budget your “extra costs” <strong>before</strong> you pay the full purchase price.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    In Kenya, your ownership is only secure when the transfer is registered at the lands registry.
    That process triggers several mandatory payments—some to the government and county, others to professionals
    helping you transfer legally and safely.
  </p>

  <h2 id="what-is-stamp-duty">1) What Is Stamp Duty in Kenya?</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp duty is a government tax paid when property ownership is transferred from seller to buyer.
    A transfer cannot be registered without proof of stamp duty payment. In most cases, stamp duty is
    calculated based on the government valuation of the property—not necessarily what you negotiated as the purchase price.
  </p>

  <h3 id="stamp-duty-rates">Stamp Duty Rates (Common Guide)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Urban areas:</strong> 4% of the government-assessed value</li>
    <li><strong>Rural areas:</strong> 2% of the government-assessed value</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout-box warning">
    <div class="callout-title">
      <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
      <span>Important Note</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      “Urban vs rural” depends on how the area is classified in practice for stamp duty assessment.
      If you’re unsure, ask your advocate early—because the rate changes your budget significantly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="how-calculated">2) How Stamp Duty Is Calculated (And Why Valuation Matters)</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp duty is calculated after the property is valued for stamp duty purposes. The government valuer/assessment process
    produces a figure used to compute duty. In many cases, this figure can differ from your negotiated price.
  </p>

  <h3>Simple Formula</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stamp Duty = Rate (2% or 4%) × Government-Assessed Value</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="examples">Realistic Examples (Easy Math)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Example A (Urban 4%):</strong> Valuation Ksh 5,000,000 → Stamp Duty = 0.04 × 5,000,000 = <strong>Ksh 200,000</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Example B (Rural 2%):</strong> Valuation Ksh 5,000,000 → Stamp Duty = 0.02 × 5,000,000 = <strong>Ksh 100,000</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout-box">
    <div class="callout-title">
      <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
      <span>Budgeting Tip</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      When you’re estimating, use a “worst-case” approach: assume the higher rate until your advocate confirms the classification.
      It prevents last-minute panic when transfer is already in progress.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="timeline">3) When Stamp Duty Is Paid in the Transfer Timeline</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp duty is typically paid after valuation and before registration. A clean timeline looks like this:
  </p>

  <div class="checklist">
    <div class="checklist-item">
      <div class="checklist-number">1</div>
      <div>
        <h3>Sale Agreement & Deposit</h3>
        <p>Agreement signed, deposit paid as agreed (ideally protected through an advocate’s client account).</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="checklist-item">
      <div class="checklist-number">2</div>
      <div>
        <h3>Searches & Clearances</h3>
        <p>Official search, rates/rent clearance, and any required consents are initiated.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="checklist-item">
      <div class="checklist-number">3</div>
      <div>
        <h3>Valuation for Stamp Duty</h3>

      <div class="checklist-number">4</div>
      <div>
        <h3>Stamp Duty Payment</h3>
        <p>Stamp duty is paid and proof is obtained.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="checklist-item">
      <div class="checklist-number">5</div>
      <div>
        <h3>Registration</h3>
        <p>Transfer documents are lodged and the ownership record is updated at the lands registry.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 id="who-pays">4) Who Pays Stamp Duty and These Costs?</h2>
  <p>
    By common practice, the buyer pays stamp duty unless the sale agreement states otherwise.
    Some costs are negotiable, so always clarify in writing.
  </p>

  <h3>Typical Cost Responsibility</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Buyer usually pays:</strong> stamp duty, valuation, advocate fees (buyer side), registration costs</li>
    <li><strong>Seller often pays:</strong> any outstanding land rates/rent arrears (unless agreed otherwise)</li>
    <li><strong>Negotiable:</strong> who pays for searches, consent processing, and specific clearance charges</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout-box warning">
    <div class="callout-title">
      <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
      <span>Common Budget Mistake</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      Paying the full purchase price without reserving funds for stamp duty and transfer costs can stall your registration.
      You may end up owning “on paper” in your mind, but not legally in the registry.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="full-cost-breakdown">5) Full Buying Cost Breakdown (What to Budget For)</h2>
  <p>
    Buying costs can be grouped into five categories: government taxes, county charges, professional fees,
    documentation/processing, and “hidden” transaction expenses.
  </p>

  <h3>A) Government Tax</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stamp duty:</strong> 2% or 4% of government-assessed value (largest cost in many transfers)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B) Government/Registry Process Costs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Registration / lodgement fees:</strong> paid during registration (amount varies by transaction)</li>
    <li><strong>Official search:</strong> a small fee for confirming ownership and encumbrances</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>C) County & Leasehold Charges</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Land rates clearance:</strong> confirms county rates are paid</li>
    <li><strong>Land rent clearance (leasehold):</strong> confirms land rent is paid where applicable</li>
    <li><strong>Consent-related fees:</strong> applies in some land categories/transactions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>D) Professional Fees</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advocate fees:</strong> conveyancing, agreement review, transfer preparation, registration follow-up</li>
    <li><strong>Surveyor fees (optional but smart):</strong> beacon verification, boundary confirmation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>E) “Hidden” or Overlooked Costs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bank charges:</strong> if buying via mortgage (valuation, legal, insurance, processing fees)</li>
    <li><strong>Rates/rent arrears:</strong> can be discovered late and must be cleared before transfer</li>
    <li><strong>Site visit due diligence:</strong> surveyor transport, multiple visits, document copies</li>
    <li><strong>Penalties:</strong> delays can trigger penalties (especially for arrears)</li>
  </ul>

      <span>Pro Tip from Unipro</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      When clients ask “how much extra should I keep aside?”, I recommend building a buffer that covers:
      <strong>stamp duty + advocate fees + valuation + clearances + a contingency buffer</strong>. It reduces stress and prevents stalled transfers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="budget-estimate">6) How Much Extra Should You Budget?</h2>
  <p>
    A safe general guide is to budget an additional <strong>5–10%</strong> of the purchase price for all fees combined.
    That range depends on: whether your stamp duty is 2% or 4%, whether the property is leasehold, and whether there are arrears.
  </p>

  <div class="callout-box">
    <div class="callout-title">
      <i class="fas fa-calculator"></i>
      <span>Quick Budget Rule</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      If you don’t want surprises: budget <strong>10%</strong> extra. If you want a tighter estimate, budget <strong>5–7%</strong> only after your advocate confirms the stamp duty rate and checks for arrears.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="how-to-reduce-delays">7) How to Reduce Delays (And Save Money)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start searches early:</strong> confirm ownership and restrictions before paying large deposits</li>
    <li><strong>Ask about arrears upfront:</strong> rates/rent arrears can stall transfers late in the process</li>
    <li><strong>Use an advocate:</strong> prevents document errors and risky agreements</li>
    <li><strong>Verify boundaries:</strong> avoids disputes and “wrong plot” situations</li>
    <li><strong>Keep a contingency buffer:</strong> reduces pressure and avoids rushed shortcuts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="special-cases">8) Special Cases That Change Your Costs</h2>

  <h3>Buying With a Mortgage</h3>
  <p>
    Buying through a bank can add extra expenses like bank valuation, mortgage legal fees, insurance requirements,
    and processing fees. Always request a cost schedule from the bank early.
  </p>

  <h3>Leasehold Property</h3>
  <p>
    Leasehold property can involve land rent clearance and checks on remaining lease years. If the lease is short,
    you may later incur renewal/extension costs (your advocate should advise).
  </p>

  <h3>Buying From a Company / Through a Company</h3>
  <p>
    The stamp duty rate usually remains the same, but documentation requirements can be heavier
    (company resolutions, CR12/ownership confirmation, director IDs, etc.), which may affect legal handling costs.
  </p>

  <h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Can stamp duty be negotiated or avoided?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      No. Stamp duty is a statutory tax and must be paid for a valid transfer. If anyone promises a “shortcut,” treat it as a red flag.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Is stamp duty refundable?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      In most cases, stamp duty is non-refundable once paid, even if a transaction collapses later. This is why strong due diligence should happen early.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Why does government valuation differ from the purchase price?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Government valuation is based on assessment methods and market references used for taxation. It may be higher or lower than your negotiated price.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Do I pay stamp duty before or after signing?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      You sign sale/transfer documents first, then valuation is done, then stamp duty is paid before registration.
      Your advocate coordinates the order to match the legal process.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">What’s the smartest way to avoid surprise fees?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Before you pay the full purchase price, insist on a “transfer cost estimate” from your advocate based on: stamp duty rate, tenure type (leasehold/freehold), and clearance status (rates/rent).
    </div>
  </div>
